# Convolutional Neural Network for Cats and Dogs

This is an application of a convolutional neural newtork to classify images of cats and dogs. Tensorflow has made working with pre-made data sets exceptionally easy. This project was intended to see how to build a network with arbitrary data to mimick a more realistic project. 

I built this neural network with Keras on Tensorflow 2.0.  

## Data:
The data for this project is the Kaggle Cats and Dogs dataset that can be found [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765).  

## Overview: 
Here I will give an overview of what is in my project.  

### 1) The Data:
After downloading the data, I examined and played around with it:
